### Student Question Helper

https://cljnilsson.github.io/StudentHelper/

Simple test app to make a student helper that is hosted on Github pages.
Hardcoded nonsense for now, unfortunately it has to be public for pages to work.

##### Dev Notes
bun run build
bun run deploy
-> Wait for github actions to publish


##### Potential Todos
* Show all questions button
* Remove question from pool once next is clicked
* previous button
* chapter subtitle
* support for more than one subject
* load questions from json or seperate ts tile
